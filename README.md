   - **Simplified**: "We need to build a new website."
   - **Complex**: "We need to construct a new website."
   - **Improvement**: "Build" relates more easily to everyday activities, making it more relatable.

3. **"Help" vs. "Facilitate"**:
   - **Simplified**: "Can you help me with this task?"
   - **Complex**: "Can you facilitate this task?"
   - **Improvement**: "Help" is straightforward, while "facilitate" may be perceived as overly formal.

4. **"Use" vs. "Utilize"**:
   - **Simplified**: "You can use this tool for your project."
   - **Complex**: "You can utilize this tool for your project."
   - **Improvement**: "Use" is clearer and more direct, enhancing understanding.

5. **"Check" vs. "Verify"**:
